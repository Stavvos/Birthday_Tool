#Birthday tool README

The file path for the birthdays.txt file needs to be added to the read_file() function found within the birthday_tool_main.py file. 

In order for the tool to work correctly birthdays are added to the birthdays.txt file. 
The format for the birthdays is: Name, day, and month. For example, "Liam 29 11".
